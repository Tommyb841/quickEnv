Getting started with quickEnv:

These series of scripts make heavy use of the Nix package management. 

If you don't have nix or nixOS setup on your machine already, 
simply run the `setup-nix` script in your terminal, like so:

```
$ git clone [paste repo link here]

$ cd quickEnv

$ ./setup-nix
```
Once that is complete you are good to go! 
Feel free to read each README within the individual programming language directories
